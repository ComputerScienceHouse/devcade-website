    <h2>What is Devcade?</h2>
    <p>
      Devcade is a fully custom arcade machine made by members at RIT's 
      <a href="https://csh.rit.edu">Computer Science House</a>. Devcade is an arcade built for 
      developers, by developers. The arcade cabinet, software, and games for Devcade were mainly
      built during the Fall 2022 semester and the project is still being maintained and updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arcade cabinet was first shown off at the 2022 
      <a href="https://rochester.makerfaire.com/">Rochester Makerfaire</a>. Devcade was also
      showcased at the April 2023 <a href="https://www.rit.edu/imagine/">ImagineRIT festival</a>
      . This cabinet is the first of its kind, but hopefully not the last.

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      Devcade is being actively developed by a group of students at RIT's 
      <a href="https://csh.rit.edu">Computer Science House</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Devcade project is led by <a href="https://noahemke.com">Noah Emke</a>, 
      a third year Game Design and Development major here at RIT. Noah leads a team of 
      about a dozen CSH members, ranging from first years to fifth years. Many team members 
      make their own games for the cabinet, while others work on the backend API and databases, 
      some on the onboard software, and some on the physical design of the cabinet itself -- 
      there really is something for everyone on this project.
