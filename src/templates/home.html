    <h2>What is Devcade?</h2>
    <p>
      Devcade is a fully custom arcade machine made by members at RIT's 
      <a href="https://csh.rit.edu">Computer Science House</a>. Devcade is an arcade built for 
      developers, by developers. The arcade cabinet, software, and games for Devcade were mainly
      built during the Fall 2022 semester, but the project is still actively maintained and updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arcade cabinet was first shown off at the 2022 
      <a href="https://rochester.makerfaire.com/">Rochester Makerfaire</a>, 
      the 2023 <a href="https://www.rit.edu/imagine/">ImagineRIT festival</a>, and the 2023 
      a href="https://rochester.makerfaire.com/">Rochester Makerfaire</a>.  The next exhibition of
      Devcade will be at ImagineRIT 2024.  This cabinet is the first of its kind, but hopefully not the last.

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      Devcade is being actively developed by a group of students at RIT's 
      <a href="https://csh.rit.edu">Computer Science House</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Devcade project is led by <a href="https://noahemke.com">Noah Emke</a>, 
      a fourth year Game Design and Development major at RIT. Noah leads a team of 
      about a dozen CSH members, ranging from first years to fifth years. Many of these team 
      members are making their own games for the cabinet, some are working on the backend 
      API and databases, some on the onboard software, and some on the physical design of the 
      cabinet itself -- there's something for everyone on this project.
